Hi, I'm Veronica Castellanos, and this is my story.
<br />
<br />
I was borned and raised in Venezuela. Graduated from dentistry school on November 2015.
I left my country on 2017 looking for opportunities I could no longer find in Venezuela.
After living some years in √Åmsterdam, I decided to move to Madrid, my hometown since 2018.
<br />
<br />
Is not a secret to anyone that, given some circumstances and the current job market, most of us had to change or redirect our careeer paths in order to find a job, or as in my case, to fit in a new country/city. Due to external reasons to me, I was not able to work as a dentist in Spain without previously doing a veeery long paperwork (and waiting).
That's why, while waiting, I found the job I still do right now at an amazing company called <a href="https://feverup.com/" target="blank">Fever</a> (I highly recommend it to you, it has a lot of fun plans in many cities!)
<br />
<br />
In the meanwhile... I found about SheCodes. I always wanted to learn coding, but didn't know where to start. After watching Matt's introduction video, I knew this was my place. I have now finished all the workshops SheCodes offer and words can't explain how wonderful this experience has been.
Now, my time has come to start entering myself in the amazing coding world, hopefully by building responsive and good looking websites. Wanna join me?
